# Smart-Resume-Reader

The Smart Resume Reader strives to imitate the ATS algorithm on a basic level. This program opens up a resume file, reads through its contents and finds the candidate's information and unique skills using regular expression. It determines if the candidate is qualified based off specified criteria, displays its descion and reasoning, and keeps track of every resume opened by the program.
