# Smart-Resume-Reader

The Smart Resume Reader strives to imitate the ATS-friendly algorithm on a basic level. This program opens a resume file, reads through its contents, and finds the candidate's information and unique skills using regular expression. It determines if the candidate is qualified based on specified criteria, displays its decision and reasoning, and keeps track of every resume opened by the program.
